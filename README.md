# RabbitMQ Objective-C and Swift client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client)

A RabbitMQ client, largely influenced by [Bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny).

Test-driven from Swift and implemented in Objective-C.

## Supported iOS and macOS Versions

This library currently targets iOS 12+ and macOS 10.12+.

## Dependencies

This library depends on

 * [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://cocoapods.org/pods/CocoaAsyncSocket)
 * [JKVValue](https://cocoapods.org/pods/JKVValue)

## Installation with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

1. Create a Cartfile with the following line:

 ```
 github "rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client" "v0.13.0"
 ```

Run Carthage, for example in a new project:

 ```
 carthage bootstrap
 ```

1. In your Xcode project, in the **Build Phases** section of your target, open up **Link
   Binary With Libraries**. Now drag e.g. `Carthage/Build/iOS/RMQClient.framework`
   (choose Mac for OSX) into this list.
1. If you don't already have one, click the '+' icon under **Build Phases** to add a
**Copy Files** phase.
1. Under **Destination**, choose **Frameworks**.
1. Click the '+' and add RMQClient.framework. Ensure **Code Sign On Copy** is checked.

## Installation with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

1. Add the following to your Podfile:

   ```
   pod 'RMQClient', git: 'https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client.git'
   ```
   We recommend adding `use_frameworks!` to enable modular imports (Objective-C only).
1. Run `pod install`.
1. Open your project with `open MyProject.xcworkspace`.

**Objective-C users:** importing with `@import RMQClient;` currently produces an error in Xcode (Could not build module 'RMQClient'), but this should not prevent code from compiling and running. Using crocodile imports avoids this Xcode bug: `#import <RMQClient/RMQClient.h>`.


## Supported Features

- [x] TLS support
- [x] Client heartbeats
- [x] Carthage support
- [x] CocoaPods support
- [x] iOS support

- [x] PKCS12 client certificates on iOS using the [TLS auth mechanism plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-mechanism-ssl)
- [ ] PKCS12 support for MacOS
- [ ] [PKCS12 client certificates on iOS using chained CAs](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/74)
- [x] [Publisher confirmations](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/68)
- [x] [Publish and consume messages as data](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/46)
- [x] [Customisable consumer hooks](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/71)
- [ ] Connection closure when broker [doesn't send heartbeats on schedule](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/41)
- [ ] [basic.return support](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/72)
- [ ] Acknowledgement [transaction support](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-objc-client/issues/73)


## Documentation

 * [Several RabbitMQ tutorials](http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html) are provided for
   this client library.

### (Basic) Usage Example

1. Instantiate an `RMQConnection`:

   ```swift
   let delegate = RMQConnectionDelegateLogger() // implement RMQConnectionDelegate yourself to react to errors
   let conn = RMQConnection(uri: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672", delegate: delegate)
   ```
1. Connect:

   ```swift
   conn.start()
   ```
1. Create a channel:

   ```swift
   let ch = conn.createChannel()
   ```
1. Use the channel:

   ```swift
   let q = ch.queue("myqueue")
   q.subscribe({ m in
      print("Received: \(String(data: m.body, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8))")
   })
   q.publish("foo".data(using: String.Encoding.utf8))
   ```

1. Close the connection when done:

   ```
   conn.close()
   ```
